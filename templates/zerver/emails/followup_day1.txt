Hi there!

Welcome to Zulip!

Zulip is the workplace communication solution that actually improves your productivity, combining the real-time nature of chat with the topic-based organization of email.  Our mission to build the best tool for collaboration.  As an open-source software project, Zulip is about community, and we're happy to have you with us.

You've come at an exciting time.  Zulip has experienced incredible growth in its codebase and developer community these past few months, with over 150 contributors on our 1.6 release (https://blog.zulip.org/2017/06/06/zulip-server-1-6-released/).  We're currently working on improving our bots and integrations framework to make it even easier to integrate Zulip into your workflow.  You should also check out our beta apps, a React Native mobile app for iOS/Android and an Electron app for Linux/Mac/Windows: {{ realm_uri }}/apps.

We hope you love using Zulip as much as we do.  If you have any feedback or want to see how we use Zulip for a large software project, swing by chat.zulip.org.

Thanks,
The Zulip Team
