Hi there!

Welcome to Zulip!

Zulip is the workplace communication solution that actually improves your productivity, combining the real-time nature of chat with the topic-based organization of email.  Our mission to build the best tool for collaboration, and we're excited to have you with us.  Zulip is free and open source.  We believe that open source is the future of software, and by choosing Zulip, you are not locked in to a single vendor for team communication needs, and you have the ability to make any small tweaks you may need to.  

Zulip has experienced incredible growth in its codebase and community these past few months, with over 150 contributors on our 1.6 release.

Zulip is open-source software, which means you're not locked into 

Check out our [alpha|beta] applications for Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android.
